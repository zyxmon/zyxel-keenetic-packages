Description:  Ezstream is a command line source client for Icecast media 
 streaming servers. It began as the successor of the old "shout" 
 utility, and has since gained a lot of useful features.
 In its basic mode of operation, it streams media files or data 
 from standard input without reencoding and thus requires only 
 very little CPU resources. It can also use various external 
 decoders and encoders to reencode from one format to another, 
 and stream the result to an Icecast server. Additional features 
 include scriptable playlist and metadata handling. All of its 
 features make ezstream a very flexible source client.

Description:  It listens to all traffic on an ethernet (or PPP) interface,
 looking for special "knock" sequences of port-hits. A client
 makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a
 port on the server. This port need not be open -- since
 knockd listens at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic
 even if it's destined for a closed port. When the server
 detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it runs a command
 defined in its configuration file. This can be used to open
 up holes in a firewall for quick access.
 This package contains the port-knocking client.

Description:  Libconfig is a simple library for manipulating structured configuration
 files. This file format is more compact and more readable than XML. And
 unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string
 parsing in application code.
 
 Libconfig is very compact -- just 38K for the stripped C shared
 library (less than one-fourth the size of the expat XML parser library)
 and 66K for the stripped C++ shared library. This makes it well-suited
 for memory-constrained systems like handheld devices.

 and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change
 the event loop.
 
 This package contains the libevent shared library historically

Description:  The libffi library provides a portable, high level programming interface to

 FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. A foreign function interface is the

 code written in another language. The libffi library really only provides the
 lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.
 A layer must exist above libffi that handles type conversions for values passed
 between the two languages.

MD5Sum: 51d9db5dfdf397eefb1447d9690e337f
Description:  libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.

 contemporary to MPEG-4's AAC and TwinVQ, the next generation beyond
 MPEG audio layer 3. Unlike the MPEG sponsored formats (and other

 All the technical details are published and documented, and any
 software entity may make full use of the format without license

 it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
 quality of the link to each machine. As it does this, it prints
 running statistics about each machine.

 provider but just use their own streaming client for example
